Exeecise for swapping variables using pointers: 

Q: Why do we use poitners instead of actual normal variables? 
A: Because when you do that, you copy the values and in the main will not show the difference. This is "Passing by value" 
   When using pointers, it takes the memory address instead of a copy and this is called "Passing by reference", doing this it will replace the values in the memory, and the 
   values will be swapped correctly since we take the address, not the copy which is destroyed when exiting the function. 

Code: 
#include <stdio.h>
void swap(int *a, int *b);

int main()
{

    // Swap 2 numbers using pointers
    int n1, n2;

    printf("Input the numbers: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &n1, &n2);

    printf("Before swapping: n1 = %d, n2 = %d\n", n1, n2);
    swap(&n1, &n2);
    printf("Afetr swapping: n1 = %d, n2 = %d\n", n1, n2);

    return 0;
}

void swap(int *a, int *b)
{
    int temp;

    temp = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = temp;
}
